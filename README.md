# Welcome to my GitHub 👋

I'm a magician  that translates strategy into actionable data solutions, accelerating adoption of digital products, and
implementing management frameworks to deliver measurable business value. 

## Complexity 🔜 Simplicity
Complexity isn’t the enemy — unmanaged complexity is. In every transformation, things could be braked down to simplicity when applying business objectives and clear strategy first. Left unchecked, it becomes a maze.
That’s why my compass always points to simplicity. Every day, week, month, quarter, every year, every evolution of a company, I search for the essence: what adds value, what can be stripped away, and what needs to grow.
Simplicity isn’t about cutting corners — it’s about _**What could or should we do?**_ 

Like magic, simplicity turns complexity from a burden into an advantage.

## 🗣 Story about me
🪄 I’m a data magician with 10+ years of conjuring strategies into reality for 50+ organizations across the globe (€10M → €3B in scale). My spellbook covers data strategy, execution, governance, cost alchemy, revenue summoning, and guiding squads of 50–300+ adventurers across data, analytics, and governance realms.

⚡ I turn big-picture visions into working data products and frameworks that actually get adopted, driving business value like Swiss clockwork. My craft thrives on co-creation, shared ownership, and making sure strategy doesn’t just sit on a slide deck, it lives, breathes, and delivers.

🔥 By blending organizational insight with technical sorcery, I help companies move faster, smarter, and leaner. Think: efficiency boosts, cost vanishings, revenue growth, and transformations that stick. Always with an eye on long-term sustainability and impact.
