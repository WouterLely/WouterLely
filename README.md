## 🗣 Story about me
🪄 I’m a data magician with 10+ years of conjuring strategies into reality for 50+ organizations across the globe (€10M → €3B in scale). My spellbook covers data strategy, execution, governance, cost alchemy, revenue summoning, and guiding squads of 50–300+ adventurers across data, analytics, and governance realms.

⚡ I turn big-picture visions into working data products and frameworks that actually get adopted, driving business value like Swiss clockwork. My craft thrives on co-creation, shared ownership, and making sure strategy doesn’t just sit on a slide deck, it lives, breathes, and delivers.

🔥 By blending organizational insight with technical sorcery, I help companies move faster, smarter, and leaner. Think: efficiency boosts, cost vanishings, revenue growth, and transformations that stick. Always with an eye on long-term sustainability and impact.
